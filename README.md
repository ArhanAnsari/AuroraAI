## Expanding File Support

To support additional file types, follow these steps:

- Use libraries like `pdfplumber` (for PDFs) and `python-docx` (for Word documents).
- Implement text extraction functions to analyze and summarize content.

### 2. **Audio Files (MP3, WAV)**
- Use `pydub` or `speechrecognition` to transcribe audio to text.
- Apply AI models for sentiment analysis or keyword extraction.

### 3. **Video Files (MP4, AVI)**
- Use `moviepy` or `OpenCV` to process video frames.
- Implement object detection and audio-to-text transcription.
